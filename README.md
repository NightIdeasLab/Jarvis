Inspired by the movie “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey Jr, i want to recreate a computer system like Jarvis.

Jarvis is a digital life assistant that assists with your daily life by acting as an alarm clock, informing you of the latest news headlines and the forecast of the weather for the next 5 days amongst other things.

For the moment the application can do:

* Greetings
* Time and date
* Calendar events
* Reminders
* Weather conditions with a 5 day forecast (from OpenWeatherMap)
* Unread email count and VIP email count (from Apple Mail app)
* News headlines (from NYTimes)
* Daily quotations (from BrainyQuote.com)

Minimum Mac OS X version is 10.7 Lion

The original code was written by [physicistjedi](http://goo.gl/MSthr).

This my morning alarm clock. Design question here is not how it looks like, or how it sounds like. The question is what do you want to hear in the morning in your bed.

an assistant for daily redunant tasks, a digital butler

Jarvis is a digital life assistant, based in the DOS language. Jarvis assists with your daily life by acting as an alarm clock, informing you of the latest news headlines and the forecast of the weather for the next 3 days amongst other things.
